50ml washing-up liquid (one part)
300ml water (six parts)
1. Measure the washing-up liquid into a container, such as a jam jar or glass bottle.

2. Slowly add in the water, being careful not to create too many bubbles at this stage. Gently stir the mixture together to combine – a chopstick is perfect for this.

3. If you can, let the bubble mixture rest before using it, as it will make your bubbles even better.

4. When you’re ready, dip your bubble wand into the mixture and start blowing bubbles!

5. optional: add 1tbsp glycerin, light corn syrup, or sugar to make bubbles last longer
